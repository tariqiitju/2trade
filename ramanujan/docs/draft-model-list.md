### **🎯 Prediction Models (Supervised)**

* **Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost):** An ensemble of decision trees that learns sequentially to correct its own mistakes, making it highly accurate.  
* **Random Forest:** An ensemble that combines many independent decision trees to make a more stable and robust prediction.  
* **Linear & Ridge Regression:** A model that finds the best straight-line relationship between input features and a target value.  
* **LSTM Networks:** A type of neural network specifically designed to find patterns in time-series or sequential data.  
* **GARCH Models:** A specialized statistical model used to forecast the volatility (choppiness) of an asset's returns.

### **🕵️ Pattern & Clustering Models (Unsupervised)**

* **K-Means Clustering:** An algorithm that groups data points into a predefined number of clusters based on their similarity.  
* **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** A probabilistic model that can identify overlapping clusters in data.  
* **Hidden Markov Models (HMM):** A model that finds underlying "hidden" states or regimes in sequential data, such as changing market conditions.

### **🔗 Relationship & Correlation Models**

* **Pearson Correlation:** Measures the strength and direction of a **linear** relationship between two instruments.  
* **Spearman & Kendall Correlation:** Rank-based methods that measure the strength of a **monotonic** (consistently increasing or decreasing) relationship, which doesn't have to be a straight line.  
* **Tail Dependence (via Copulas):** An advanced method that measures how assets move together during **extreme market events**.  
* **Mutual Information:** A measure from information theory that can detect **any type of statistical relationship**, linear or not.
